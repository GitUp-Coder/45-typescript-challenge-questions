/*Question no 22 : Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen.
Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program*/
// Array of fruits
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
// Intentional error: Access an index that doesn't exist
console.log(fruits[3]); // This line will produce an error
// Correct the error: Access an existing index
console.log(fruits[1]); // This line is correct and will not produce an error
export {};
